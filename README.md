The website features a clean, modern design with a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity. The homepage includes a dynamic slideshow, a navigation menu, and interactive elements like buttons and forms. I focused on ensuring fast load times and a smooth user experience.
